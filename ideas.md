Outstanding developments:
- [ ] allow the ai to use venice ai through their openai api as model entpoint
- [ ] we need to check the DIEM balance of venice regularly because we have only a limited daily budget for inference
- [ ] we need to add groq ondemand as possible endpoint (although it has a very limited free compute budget) maybe we can use multiple accounts ?
- [ ] we need a strategy how the AI can improve itself without breaking its functionality (it should be able to test changed in a sandbox ? how to implement this ?)
